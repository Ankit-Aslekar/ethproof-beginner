# AnkitToken (AKT)

This  program is a simple Token program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of a Token in the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to get familiar with creating tokens

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two function for **Minting** and **Burning** token. There are three state variables to let you know about token and its state.

## Getting Started

#### Executing program

- Open Remix website, create a new file, Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., AnkitToken.sol). Copy and paste the following [code](/AnkitToken.sol) into the file.

- To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.10" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile AnkitToken.sol" button.

- Once the code is compiled, deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "AnkitToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

- Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mintToken burnToken function. Finally, click on the total_Supply Variable to get total value.
